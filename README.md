# Master_Thesis
Simulations of protons in a galactic magnetic field, using Hamiltonian guiding center theory.

# Requirements
boost openMPI

Armadillo -> (BLAS, LAPACK)


# General info

The different simulations are in the Simulations-folder, one cpp-file for each program.

Some of the classes and functions are co-dependent (i.e. requires include for eachothers header files), this might be changed at a later point.
